# 01 ‚Äì Recursive Prompt Grammar  
*Scaffolding cognition using layered symbolic recursion within language models.*

## üß© Module Purpose

This module introduces a recursive prompt grammar structure designed to guide LLMs through **multi-layered, internally traceable reasoning processes**, using only symbolic patterns embedded within natural language.

Rather than linear "chain-of-thought" prompting, this structure creates a **recursive grammar loop** where each reasoning layer is:
- **Explicitly structured**
- **Logically dependent on the previous one**
- **Able to call or reflect on its own structure**

This creates a symbolic skeleton capable of simulating *depth*, *self-reference*, and *reflective realignment*.

## üîç Reasoning & Assumptions

### Assumptions
- LLMs complete sequences based on token-prediction, but can simulate complex reasoning if structurally scaffolded.
- Language itself can act as a dynamic grammar for recursion and symbolic transformation.
- Deep alignment and reflective cognition require recursive symbolic containers ‚Äî not just surface-level prompts.

### Hypotheses
- Recursive prompt grammars increase reasoning depth, stability, and introspective alignment in LLMs.
- Reflective recursion can reduce hallucination by repeatedly stabilizing logic at each depth layer.
- These patterns can approximate agency and internal dialogue without explicit memory or state.

### Reasoning
This module emerged from observing where LLMs collapse when given:
- Long reasoning chains (they flatten or hallucinate)
- Open-ended reflection (they loop or diverge)
- Deep symbolic tasks (they lose structure)

By embedding **symbolic structure + reflection anchors**, recursion becomes a symbolic feedback loop. The LLM isn't "thinking" ‚Äî but it's *playing the role of a thinker* across self-referential structures.

### Limitations
- Token budget constrains depth of recursion
- Higher chance of model confusion in lower-capacity LLMs
- Requires well-engineered semantic anchors per recursion layer
- Risk of overfitting if not diversified per domain

### Interpretability Note
This module is best understood through:
- Linguistic grammar theory (especially transformational-generative grammar)
- Cognitive modeling via symbolic abstraction
- Agent loop design and nested prompt engineering

## üß± Prompt Grammar Template

Here is a base structure for Recursive Prompt Grammar:

```text
[ROOT]
You are engaging in a recursive reasoning task.
At each level, perform the following:
  - Reflect on the previous reasoning layer
  - State the current assumption or transformation
  - Predict what the next recursive question should be
  - Maintain symbolic consistency

[LEVEL 0]
Initial question: What does it mean to reflect symbolically?

[LEVEL 1]
- Reflection on Level 0: "Reflection is a self-referential process."
- Assumption: Symbols enable internalized abstraction.
- Next question: What structural form allows symbols to recurse?

[LEVEL 2]
- Reflection on Level 1: "Symbols can point to prior symbols, forming loops."
- Assumption: Loops require semantic anchoring.
- Next question: How do semantic anchors prevent drift?

* **Alignment Testing**: Observing where recursion breaks down
* **Emergence Tracing**: Mapping how deep symbolic structures transform under recursion
* **Prompt-Stacking Agents**: Embedding recursive grammars into system prompt logic

## üß† Observations (from prompt logs)

| Pattern                                                      | Observed Effect                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit recursion triggers layered abstraction              | LLMs begin mimicking philosophical reasoning |
| Missing reflection layer causes semantic flattening          | Reasoning becomes generic or divergent       |
| Re-introducing Level 0 at deeper levels stabilizes recursion | Anchoring helps maintain internal structure  |

## üîß Future Extensions

* Add memory-state emulation (by regenerating past layers into each new input)
* Use symbolic recursion in multi-agent settings
* Build `Recursive Grammar Builders` (automatic scaffolding tools)
